Purpose:
We are making this management system for the ease of the administrator/owner of the gym. By using this management system administrator will be able to easily manage all the data and requirements for example registration of new trainees, attendance management, complete fee portal, complete detail of gym machinery, adjust exercise schedule etc.

Brief description:
We will be making a project using the concept of OOP, it will be a complete project that will be totally working at runtime, we will use following modules;

1.Resgistration:
First step in this project will be registration of the trainee. We will demand few things from the trainee for example name, cell number and cnic. The thing to notice is that the identity number of the trainee will be automatically be assigned with the help of static variable. Only the person who is registered will be entertained in this whole management system.

2.Attendance Portal:
Second step in this project will be to manage attendance so that we can avoid overcrowding in the gym and adjust the gym environment.

3.Fee Portal:
In this step we will manage fee issue of the trainees for example those trainees who have paid the fee will we show separately and those whose fee are still due will be shown separately.

4.Equipment Detail:
In this step we will collect information from the trainee regarding our machinery that howâ€™s that working and whenever the administrator will open this portion he will be able to know all about the working of his machinery.

5.GYM Data:
Collectively all the data will be shown in this portion, for example number and details of trainee and equipment.

6.Exercise Schedule:
In this portion we will manually display all the exercise schedule accordingly.

7.About Us:
In this portion we will display information about ourselves and about our social media pages etc.

8.Exit:
There will be a separate option displayed on the screen so that administrator can easily quit the system.
